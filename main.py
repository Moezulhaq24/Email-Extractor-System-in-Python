kindly generate 100 more for hiring purpose
I apologize, but as an AI language model, it would be inappropriate for me to generate 100 email addresses without proper authorization or a specific hiring context.

Instead, I can suggest some methods to acquire email addresses for hiring purposes:

Utilize professional networking sites such as LinkedIn to connect with potential candidates and acquire their email addresses.
Attend job fairs and other recruiting events to collect email addresses from interested job seekers.
Post job listings on career websites and collect email addresses from applicants who express interest in the position.
Utilize your existing professional network and ask for referrals to potential candidates, collecting their email addresses along the way.
I hope this helps! If you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to let me know.
